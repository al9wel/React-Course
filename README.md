# 📚 React Course Project

This repository contains exercises and examples from a **React course**.  
Each lesson has its own **branch**, allowing you to explore and practice specific concepts separately.

For example:

- `component` branch → Examples and exercises in component.
- `props` branch → Examples and exercises in props.
- `useState` branch → Examples and exercises using `useState` hook.
- `useEffect` branch → Examples using `useEffect` hook.
- `Routes` branch → Examples using React Router.
- ..etc

And so on for each lesson.
